## About the Client

The client owns multiple internet cafes across different locations and needed a centralized system to monitor and manage their operations. They were facing challenges with:

- Managing multiple branches independently
- Tracking PC usage and revenue across locations
- Maintaining consistent service quality
- Processing transactions and generating reports
- Real-time monitoring of PC status and usage

## Project Background

The Internet Cafe Management System is a comprehensive full-stack solution designed to centralize and streamline the operations of multiple internet cafe branches.

</div>

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Admin Dashboard (Next.js)**

   - Modern, responsive interface built with Next.js and Shadcn UI
   - Real-time monitoring capabilities
   - Role-based access control
   - Comprehensive reporting and analytics

2. **Backend API (Express.js)**

   - RESTful API architecture
   - PostgreSQL database with TypeORM
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based authorization
   - Transaction management

3. **Real-time Communication (Socket.IO)**
   - Bi-directional communication between PCs and dashboard
   - Real-time status updates
   - Instant transaction processing
   - Live monitoring capabilities

### Key Features

1. **Device Management**
2. **Branch Management**
3. **Transaction Management**
4. **Bookkeeping Report**
5. **Role-based Authentication**

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Race Condition Prevention

One of the most critical challenges was preventing race conditions during transaction processing.

### 2. N+1 Query Optimization

To prevent N+1 query issues, we implemented:

- Eager loading of related entities
- Custom query builders
- Optimized JOIN operations

### 3. Real-time Communication

Implementing real-time features required careful consideration of:

- Connection management
- Event handling
- Error recovery
- State synchronization

### 4. Security Implementation

Security was a top priority, implemented through:

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Request validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

This project demonstrates the successful implementation of a complex, distributed system with multiple moving parts, while maintaining high standards of code quality, security, and user experience.
