I'm a Web Programmer with 1 year experiences working in Square Indonesia and Kardusinfo Indonesia. I am enthusiastic about exploring for web development. I graduated from University of Amikom Yogyakarta in 2022, majoring in Informatics.

I specialize in backend programming, but I also tinker in frontend technology in my spare time. From my experiences, I honed my skills in translating UI designs into functional frontend code, revamping user flows for better experience, and building an API and clear documentation.

I'm comfortable working with MySQL databases, and I thrive in collaborative environments where I can share ideas and learn from others. When I'm not coding, you might find me tinkering with new technologies, or diving into a good book. Ô∏è

Also i have contribute to open source project:
