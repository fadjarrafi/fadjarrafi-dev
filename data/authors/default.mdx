Hey there! I'm Fadjar, a full-stack developer who gets genuinely excited about building things that solve real problems. When I'm not optimizing React components or debugging Laravel APIs, you'll find me experimenting with new coffee brewing methodsâ€”because both coding and coffee require patience, precision, and a willingness to iterate until you get it right.

My journey started in retail, where I learned the importance of understanding user needs firsthand. Those late-night shifts gave me time to dive into JavaScript tutorials, and three years later, I'm building scalable applications that serve thousands of users across Indonesia's hospitality industry.

What drives me? The moment when a complex problem clicks into a simple, elegant solution. Whether it's reducing API response times by 40% or finding the perfect grind size for a new coffee bean, I love the process of continuous improvement.

My approach is simple: Write clean code, ask good questions, and never stop learning. I believe the best solutions come from understanding both the technical requirements and the human experience behind them.

Additionally, I have contributed to open-source projects:
