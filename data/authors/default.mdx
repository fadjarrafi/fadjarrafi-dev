I am a web programmer with over a year of experience, currently working as a full-stack developer. I graduated in 2022 with a major in Informatics and have a strong enthusiasm for exploring web development.

While I specialize in backend programming, I also enjoy working with frontend technologies in my spare time. Through my experiences, I have honed my skills in translating UI designs into functional frontend code, improving user flows for a better experience, and building APIs with clear documentation.

I am comfortable working with MySQL databases and thrive in collaborative environments where I can share ideas and learn from others. When Iâ€™m not coding, you can often find me experimenting with new technologies or diving into a good book.

Additionally, I have contributed to open-source projects:
