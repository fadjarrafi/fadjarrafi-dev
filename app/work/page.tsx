          <p>
            During my time in hospitality technology, I spearheaded the development of a
            comprehensive Android application that revolutionized the guest experience. Built using
            Java, this application served as a central hub for hotel services, room controls, and
            IPTV streaming capabilities. To complement this guest-facing solution, I designed and
            implemented a robust Content Management System (CMS) using PHP and Laravel, which
            empowered hotel staff and administrators to manage IPTV content, schedules, and user
            settings in real-time.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key achievement was the seamless integration of APIs that facilitated fluid
            communication between the Android application, the CMS, and the company's backend
            infrastructure, ensuring instantaneous updates and data synchronization. Beyond
            development, I took charge of maintaining and optimizing internal systems, with a
            particular focus on network monitoring tools, which was crucial in delivering reliable
            service across both internal operations and customer-facing products.

            My time at Square Indonesia was focused on enhancing user experience and website
            functionality. I designed an intuitive graphical user interface that streamlined user
            interaction and improved overall accessibility. Additionally, I converted mockups into a
            functional landing page using HTML, Javascript, and TailwindCSS.

            Collaborating closely with UI designers, I redesigned the company profile page,

            with clients to address their needs and optimize the website based on their feedback.

            At Kardusinfo Indonesia, I played a key role in building robust and user-centric web
            applications. I designed and implemented an efficient backend system using the Laravel

            I also contributed to the design and development of databases using MySQL, ensuring
            seamless integration with frontend systems. Through collaboration with other teams, I
            helped define user features and requirements, leading to a significant reduction in
            feature gaps. Additionally, I executed end-to-end REST API development, including
            integration, documentation, and testing using PostmanAPI.
